# Foundation, for WordPress, by Evoratec

Foundation, for WordPress, is a blank starter theme with the exceptional capabilities of [ZURB's Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

As a neat-freak designer, it's sometimes intimidating and frustrating looking at a WordPress theme framework that's jam-packed with unnecessary extras and bloated code. That's why I created Foundation, for WordPress, which offers only the necessary essentials to get your site running, with all the jazz of responsive web-design.

"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." ~ Hans Hofmann, Introduction to the Bootstrap, 1993
